Syllabus Topics discussed during Michaelmas Term include: Statistical Review: Populations, parameters and random sampling; finite-sample properties of estimators, introduction to asymptotic theory; methods of estimation (method of moments, maximum likelihood, least squares, interval estimation); hypothesis testing. The Simple Regression Model: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation; properties of OLS; Goodness of Fit; Functional Form. Multiple Regression Analysis: Estimation and interpretation; model specification (determining which variables to include and which functional form to use); the multicollinearity problem Inference: hypothesis testing in the context of multiple regression analysis using t-tests and F-tests. Misspecification of Disturbance Terms: Heteroscedasticity Topics discussed during Hilary Term include: Dummy Variables and Qualitative Choice Models: Binary and categorical explanatory variables in regression analysis; interaction terms; binary dependent variables – the linear probability and probit models Introduction to Time-Series Analysis: Stationarity/non-stationarity; unit roots and cointegration; MA, AR and ARMA models Instrumental Variables Estimation: Omitted variables and endogeneity; two stage least squares estimation; testing for endogeneity and overidentifying restrictions. Simultaneous Equation Models: Simultaneity bias in OLS; Structural and reduced forms; the identification problem; estimation.
