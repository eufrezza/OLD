abstract: 'In this paper, I explore whether being a victim or survivor of intimate-partner-violence (IPV) affects
one’s tolerance of violence. Specifically I study whether and to which extent the acceptability
of violence is a coping mechanism for IPV victims and survivors. I do this in the context of India.
I first study the short-term effect of exposure to IPV on its acceptance. I exploit the exogenous
variation of Minimum-Legal-Drinking-Age policies across different Indian states, using a Regression
Discontinuity Design. Findings show that when husbands are legally allowed to drink, their
wives’ prevalence of violence increases by 4-5 percentage points. However, the increase in violence
in the short term does not translate into a change in attitudes towards IPV. To study the
long-term effects, I test whether attitudes towards IPV are affected by the length of exposure to
violence. To do so, I implement an event study design where I compare couples living in states
where the husbands are legally allowed to drink at age 21 to states where they are allowed at age
25. Results show that younger age at drinking increases the duration of abuse up to 6 months.
I also find that wives’ exposure to violence can increase their tolerance towards intimate partner
violence (IPV) by up to 0.36 standard deviations. These findings suggest that the longer the duration
of violence, the more the victims tend to find violence acceptable as a coping mechanism.'
