abstract: ' I study whether intimate partner violence has a causal effect on victims’ tolerance towards it in a context where divorce is very costly. First, I show theoretically that tolerance of violence can serve as a coping mechanism for victims of violence, particularly under prolonged exposure to abuse. I empirically test this hypothesis in the context of India. To do so, I leverage variation in the minimum legal drinking age within and across Indian states, employing a regression discontinuity design and an event study approach. The findings show that when husbands attain the legal drinking age, there is a 4-5 percentage points increase in the likelihood that their wives experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) during the past year. In the short-run, this does not lead to a change in wives’ attitudes towards IPV. To study the effect of prolonged exposure to IPV on attitudes, I compare couples living in states with legal drinking ages of 21 and 25. I find that earlier legal drinking increases the exposure to violence by up to 6 months, which in turn increases wives’ tolerance towards violence by up to 0.3 standard deviations. These findings suggest that the longer the exposure to violence, the more the victims may normalise and justify violence inflicted on them as a coping mechanism.'
