I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/Economics/) and an [Irish Research Council Scholar](https://research.ie/), under the supervision of [Selim Gulesci](https://sites.google.com/view/selimgulesci/home?authuser=0) and [Alejandra Ramos](https://sites.google.com/site/alejandraramosmoreno/). I am also affiliated with the [Trinity Impact Evaluation Unit (TIME)](https://www.tcd.ie/time/). My fields of research are at the intersection between Gender and Development Economics.

NEWS: I have been awarded the [Luca D'Agliano](https://www.fondazioneeinaudi.it/en/participate/scholarships) Research Grant to pursue my research on Intimate Partner Violence and gender norms! 

I will be on the 2023-2024 job market.
